# Integrations

Velu AI works best when it’s connected to the tools you already use for docs, collaboration, and product development.

Right now, Velu supports:

- GitHub
- Google Drive
- Slack
- Linear

---

## GitHub

Use this when your docs and/or code live in GitHub.

What Velu does with GitHub:

- Scans your documentation repo (Markdown / MDX).
- Tracks changes in specific folders (for example `/docs`, `/api`, `/guides`).
- Suggests doc updates when code, APIs, or configs change.
- Can open pull requests with draft documentation changes.

---

## Google Drive

Use this when your docs live as Google Docs instead of code.

What Velu does with Google Drive:

- Connects to selected folders that contain your documentation.
- Reads doc structure and content to understand your help center / guides.
- Suggests updates when connected product sources change.
- Keeps a mapping between product areas and the docs that describe them.

---

## Slack

Slack is used for notifications and collaboration.

What Velu does with Slack:

- Sends notifications when new doc suggestions or updates are triggered.
- Can be part of a specific channel (for example: `#docs-updates`).
- Single right click from slack can send out udpates to velu
- Lets your team quickly click through to review or approve changes.

---

## Linear

Use this if your team uses Linear to manage product work and issues.

What Velu does with Linear:

- Links documentation suggestions to Linear issues.
- Helps you see which features/issues still need docs.
- Optionally creates follow-up tasks when important doc gaps are detected.
