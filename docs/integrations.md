# Integrations

Velu AI works best when it’s connected to the tools you already use for docs, collaboration, and product development.

Right now, Velu supports:

- GitHub
- Google Drive
- Slack
- Linear

---

## GitHub

Use this when your docs and/or code live in GitHub.

What Velu does with GitHub:

- Scans your documentation repo (Markdown / MDX).
- Tracks changes in specific folders (for example `/docs`, `/api`, `/guides`).
- Suggests doc updates when code, APIs, or configs change.
- Can open pull requests with draft documentation changes.

**Setup:**

1. In Velu AI, go to **Integrations → GitHub**.
2. Click **Connect GitHub** and authorize Velu.
3. Select the organization/user and repositories you want Velu to watch.
4. Confirm the default branch (for example: `main`).
5. (Optional) Limit Velu to specific folders like `/docs` or `/api`.

## Google Drive

Use this when your docs live as Google Docs instead of code.

What Velu does with Google Drive:

- Connects to selected folders that contain your documentation.
- Reads doc structure and content to understand your help center / guides.
- Suggests updates when connected product sources change.
- Keeps a mapping between product areas and the docs that describe them.

**Setup:**

1. In Velu AI, go to **Integrations → Google Drive**.
2. Click **Connect** and grant access with your Google account.
3. Choose the folders that contain your documentation.
4. Save the integration.

## Slack

Slack is used for notifications and collaboration.

What Velu does with Slack:

- Sends notifications when new doc suggestions or updates are triggered.
- Can be part of a specific channel (for example: `#docs-updates`).
- Single right click from slack can send out udpates to velu
- Lets your team quickly click through to review or approve changes.

**Setup:**

1. In Velu AI, go to **Integrations → Slack**.
2. Click **Add to Slack**.
3. Choose the workspace and channel where Velu should post.
4. Confirm permissions and save.

## Linear

Use this if your team uses Linear to manage product work and issues.

What Velu does with Linear:

- Links documentation suggestions to Linear issues.
- Helps you see which features/issues still need docs.
- Optionally creates follow-up tasks when important doc gaps are detected.

**Setup:**

1. In Velu AI, go to **Integrations → Linear**.
2. Click **Connect** and authorize Velu.
3. Select the teams and projects that are relevant to your docs.
4. Decide how you want Velu to create or link issues (for example: one issue per feature, or per doc).
