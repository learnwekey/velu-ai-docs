# Integrations

## Velu works best when it's connected to the tools where work and documentation already happen

Connect an integration 

## What integrations do in Velu

Velu uses integrations as context and triggers so it always knows what changed and what to update next:

1. Connect tools across documentation, collaboration, and product work.
2. Velu detects a change or receives a trigger from those sources.
3. Velu suggests documentation updates and points to the right pages or files.
4. The team reviews and publishes through pull requests or doc edits.

## Why this helps

These outcomes keep your team focused:

- Keep documentation current without scanning every repository or folder manually.
- Reduce missed updates by surfacing changes as soon as they happen.
- Clarify ownership by showing who should review suggested edits.
- Shorten review cycles with ready-to-review drafts in your existing tools.
- Cut down on chasing teams for status with shared notifications and tasks.
