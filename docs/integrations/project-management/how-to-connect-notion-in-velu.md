Velu AI, the artificial intelligence assistant for Velu, syncs with Notion so your content and product teams can keep documentation aligned with what they're releasing.

## What Velu AI Does with Notion

With the Notion integration, Velu AI helps you:

- Start documentation updates directly from Notion whenever your team flags a page that needs changes.
- Use Notion pages and databases as context inside Velu AI so suggested updates stay aligned with the work your team tracks.
- Reduce context switching by keeping documentation drafts and Notion workspaces synchronized.
- Track structure changes across the selected workspace and create tasks when a release needs new or updated documentation.
