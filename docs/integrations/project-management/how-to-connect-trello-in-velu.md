Velu AI, the artificial intelligence assistant for Velu, connects your documentation work to Trello so teams can manage content updates alongside the boards they're already using.

## What Velu AI Does with Trello

With the Trello integration, Velu AI helps you:

- Start documentation updates directly from Trello whenever a card calls for new or updated docs.
- Use Trello cards and checklists as context inside Velu AI so suggested updates stay aligned with work in progress.
- Reduce context switching by keeping documentation work visible on the Trello boards your team already uses.
- Create follow-up cards or checklists to cover documentation gaps before they slip.

1. In Velu AI, choose **Integrations > Trello** to open the integration settings.
