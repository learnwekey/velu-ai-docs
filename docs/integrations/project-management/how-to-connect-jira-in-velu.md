Velu AI, the artificial intelligence assistant for Velu, links your documentation work directly to Jira so your product, engineering, and content teams can track doc updates alongside what they're shipping.

## What Velu AI Does with Jira

With the Jira integration, Velu AI helps you:

- Trigger documentation updates from Jira the moment a story or epic moves into implementation.
- Reuse Jira fields, comments, and attachments as Velu AI context so drafted changes answer the ticket.
- Keep writers and product managers in the same backlog by surfacing doc status directly alongside sprint boards.
- Log dedicated Jira tasks whenever Velu AI detects a documentation gap so nothing leaves the sprint undone.
