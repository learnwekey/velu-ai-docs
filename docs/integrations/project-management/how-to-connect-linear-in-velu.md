Velu AI links your documentation work directly to Linear so your product and engineering teams can track doc updates alongside what they're shipping.

## What Velu AI Does with Linear

With the Linear integration, Velu AI helps you:

- Initiate documentation revisions directly from Linear whenever an issue indicates a docs change.
- Bring issue details—assignees, projects, and status—into Velu AI so proposed updates match tracked work.
- Stay in Linear while reviewing documentation progress because the integration keeps it linked to the same views your teams use.
- Schedule follow-up issues when Velu AI spots missing docs to keep delivery checklists current.
