Velu AI, the artificial intelligence assistant for Velu, connects your documentation work to Asana so teams can stay ahead of content updates alongside the projects they're managing.

## What Velu AI Does with Asana

With the Asana integration, Velu AI helps you:

- Start documentation updates directly from Asana whenever a task calls for new or updated documentation.
- Use Asana tasks and subtasks as context inside Velu AI so suggested updates stay aligned with project work.
- Reduce context switching by keeping documentation work visible alongside the Asana projects your team manages.
- Create tasks to close documentation gaps before releases go live.
