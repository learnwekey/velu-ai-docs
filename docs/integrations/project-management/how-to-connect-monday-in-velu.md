Velu AI, the artificial intelligence assistant for Velu, links your documentation work to monday.com so cross-functional teams can keep documentation updates aligned with the boards they're planning in.

## What Velu AI Does with monday.com

With the monday.com integration, Velu AI helps you:

- Start documentation updates directly from monday.com whenever a board item needs new or updated docs.
- Use monday.com items as context inside Velu AI so suggested updates stay aligned with the fields your team tracks.
- Reduce context switching by keeping documentation work visible on the same boards your team plans in.
- Create tasks to catch documentation gaps before launches go live.
