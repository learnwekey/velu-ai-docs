# Overview

Welcome to the Velu AI documentation.

Velu AI is a technical writing agent that helps teams keep their product and API documentation up to date automatically. It connects to your content sources, acts upon your updatation triggers and applies documentation updates so your customer-facing docs never go stale.


## Who Velu AI is for

Velu AI is designed for:

- Product and technical writers who own customer facing documentation
- Product managers who need release notes and feature docs updated

If your docs live in GitHub (or any repo) and you often think “I’ll update this later” but never do, Velu AI is for you.

## What Velu AI does

At a high level, Velu AI helps you:

- Understands products changes shared
- Identifies which pages in your docs are affected
- Propose documentation changes in clean, reviewable text with a diff view
- Initiates a pull request to push the documentation changes

## How Velu AI fits into your workflow

1. Connect your documentation repository (for example: a Docusaurus or Markdown docs repo).
2. Trigger an documentation update.
3. Velu shares a suggested change.
4. You review, edit, and approve the changes.
